  			<h3>Consultants:</h3>
  			<p>Each consultant working for _____ has been extensively educated in the various applications processes. Additionally, 
  			many are specialized in one area to maximize the knowledge of the whole organization. Our essay experts have 
  			thoroughly analyzed the best techniques and responses along with being skilled writers themselves. Interviewing and 
  			touring experts have been through the processes themselves and in my cases have been tour guides for the schools 
  			they went to and reached out to their admissions officers for extra tips. Many of our staff members have been athletes 
  			who have reached out to coaches themselves and will be able to extend their knowledge to aid consultees. Along with 
  			these specializations, all of our members have personally been through the applications process for boarding schools.</p> 
			<!-- add image here -->
  			<h3>Our Mission:</h3>
  			<p>While we understand that not everyone will be able to go to their number one school, we make it our mission to 
  			give each and every one of our consultees the maximum chance of being accepted in the boarding school of 
  			their choice. With our staff members having gone to boarding school, we understand the unique memories that are
  			created there and wish to share these fruitful experiences with as many students as we can. Additionally,
  			we want to make the process less confusing as we have been through the strenuous process ourselves. The
  			application is difficult to complete alone, so we offer services to aid anybody who needs help.
  			 
  			</p> 
  			<h3>Our Program:</h3>
  			<p>Our program is designed to enhance consultees chances of acceptance. Additionally, the program is clear and organized to
  			ease the difficulty and confusion often brought by such long processes. We make a schedule that's flexible and
  			customized. We notify you well in advance for due dates. We make ourselves available for calls to consult and aid
  			if consultees have any questions. And we offer a list of checkpoints to mark off progress along the way. Additional
  			information is offered to help with essay writing, touring and interviewing in case of scheduling conflicts with
  			consulting calls. We give guidelines and direction for SSAT prep. And we have templates for contacting coaches.</p>

		<div id="FAQ" class="tabcontent">
  			<h4>Where do I start?</h4>
  			<p>You have come to the right place! Our program is designed not only to help you with acceptance, but also to make 
  			sure that you will enjoy wherever you go. This site offers plenty of direction without ever needing to sign up.
  			You never have to make any commitments until you know you are ready. Some starters would be to research locations
  			or schools online, reach out to friends or family who have been, or create an account with us! Skim over the questions
  			below and see what decisions you are most comfortable with making. Make sure to check out the schools tab to find schools in
  			specific locations.</p>
  			<h4>What is boarding school?</h4>
  			<p>Boarding schools can take many forms (refer to the next question). A typical boarding school offers dormitories
  			which allows students who live far away to spend their schoolyear on campus. Boarding schools take in an array of students
  			who not only come from different states but also different countries. These schools hire the best teachers possible giving
  			students an education more rigorous than public school. Class size is smaller compared to most other schools and total population
  			is also significantly lower. </p>
